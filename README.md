# MLP-Visualizer-3D

**MLP-Visualizer-3D** is an interactive 3D visualization tool for exploring the structure and weights of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Built using Python (for generating and training data) and Three.js (for rendering a 3D graph), this tool provides an engaging way to visualize and interact with the structure and dynamics of neural networks.

## üåü Features

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The repository is organized into **backend** and **frontend** directories to separate concerns:

### **Backend**  
Contains the core logic for defining and training the neural network using PyTorch and for handling server-side communication:  
- **`models/`**  
  - `simple_nn.py`: Implements a simple feedforward neural network using PyTorch.  
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    
    class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3, 8)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(8, 4)
            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(4, 2)
    
        def forward(self, x):
            x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
            x = self.fc3(x)
            return x
    ```
- **`services/`**  
  - `model_service.py`: Provides APIs for training and predicting with the neural network.  
  - `trainer.py`: Handles the training logic for the MLP model.  

- **`utils/`**  
  - `data_formatter.py`: Prepares data for training and testing.  

- **`websockets/`**  
  - `client_handler.py`: Manages WebSocket communication between the backend and frontend.  
  - `server.py`: Runs the WebSocket server to enable real-time updates.

### **Frontend**  
Focuses on rendering the 3D visualization and enabling user interactions:  
- **`assets/`**  
  - Houses resources like stylesheets and configuration files.  

- **`components/`**  
  - `Edge.tsx`: Renders connections (edges) between neurons in the network.  
  - `NeuralNetwork.tsx`: The main component for visualizing the neural network structure.  
  - `Node.tsx`: Represents individual neurons in the visualization.  
  - `SideBar.tsx`: Provides controls for interacting with the visualization.  
  - `styles.ts`: Contains styling configurations for the components.  
  - `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types for the neural network.  

- **`utils/`**  
  - `calculations.ts`: Includes utility functions for calculations related to 3D rendering.  
  - `constants.ts`: Contains reusable constants for the application.  

### Additional Files
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Configuration for Vite, the frontend build tool.  
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration for styling.  
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.  
- **`package.json`**: Contains dependencies and scripts for the frontend.  


## API Contract: WebSocket Training Data Payload

This document outlines the structure and rules for the WebSocket payload sent during the training process. Developers can use this information to extend the functionality of the system without breaking existing features.


### **Payload Overview**
The WebSocket sends a JSON object for each training step, containing metadata about the training process, model structure, and layer details. This payload is structured as follows:

```json
{
  "epoch": <integer>,              // Current epoch number (1-indexed)
  "batch": <integer>,              // Current batch number (1-indexed)
  "loss": <float>,                 // Current loss value
  "learning_rate": <float>,        // Current learning rate
  "batch_size": <integer>,         // Number of samples in the current batch
  "model_structure": {             // Metadata about the model
    "total_layers": <integer>,     // Total number of layers
    "total_params": <integer>,     // Total number of trainable parameters
    "total_epochs": <integer>,     // Total number of epochs
    "layer_details": [             // Details of each layer
      {
        "layer_name": <string>,    // Name of the layer
        "input_size": <integer>,   // Input size of the layer
        "output_size": <integer>   // Output size of the layer
      }
    ]
  },
  "layers": [                      // Training details for each layer
    {
      "layer": <string>,           // Name of the parameter (e.g., "fc1.weight")
      "weights": <array>,          // Current weights of the parameter
      "gradients": <array|null>,   // Gradients of the parameter (if available)
      "biases": <array>            // Bias values (if applicable)
    }
  ]
}
